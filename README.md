# Sweden Weather Visualization Project
This project provides a clear and open-source platform to display daily weather data for several locations in Sweden (main cities and cities I have visited). It focuses on four weather variables for nine weather stations: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, and precipitation. The data is sourced from CSV files updated daily, making this website a reliable resource for users interested in recent weather trends.

And here it is the result: [Är det varmt just nu?](https://pablo-ferro.github.io/SwedishWeather/)

### Key Features
Weather Stations: The website covers nine important weather stations in Sweden: Stockholm-Observatoriekullen A, Stockholm-Arlanda Flygplats, Uppsala Flygplats, Västerås, Göteborg A, Malmö A, Umeå Flygplats, Kiruna Flygplats, and Luleå-Kallax Flygplats.
Weather Data: The website visualizes four key weather parameters:
Maximum temperature (°C)
Minimum temperature (°C)
Average temperature (°C)
Precipitation (mm)

Interactive Map: The project uses Leaflet to plot the locations of these weather stations on an interactive map. The stations are marked with color-coded circular markers that change based on the station's average temperature, offering an easy way to identify warmer or colder regions.

Responsive Table: Below the map, a table lists the weather data for each station, making it easy to compare values across locations.

Precipitation Visualization: A unique section next to the table displays the amount of precipitation for each station as a blue circle, where the size of each circle reflects the level of rainfall. Tooltips provide the exact value and station name for a detailed look.

### The goal of Is it hot in Sweden today?
The goal is to provide an open and user-friendly source of weather data, offering transparency and easy access for the public.
